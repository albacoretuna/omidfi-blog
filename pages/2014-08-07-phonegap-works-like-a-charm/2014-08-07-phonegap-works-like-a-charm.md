Today I tried Phomegap to build an app. I made up a simple touch and draw program, containing a html file and the jquery library. Then I simply put them in a zipped file and uploaded to phone gap. In a minute my apo was ready for Android and Iphone!
  
I downloaded and tested the apk file on my android phpne and it works! You can also try it. [Click here to download the apk file.](http://xapa.bugs3.com/tc.apk)
