I came across code.org today. It offeres 20 tutorials, each named as an Hour of Code. It uses block based programming education, and it&#8217;s aimed at young learners. I had fun following the first tutorial on the website though <img src="http://modestdeveloper.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Besides the instructors are people like Bill Gates and &#8230;
