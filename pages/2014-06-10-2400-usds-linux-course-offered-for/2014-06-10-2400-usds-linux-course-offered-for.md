Wow! The linux foundation wants to offer its expensive introduction to linux course for free, cooperating with EDX.

I signed up for the course immediately, hopefully I manage to complete it.

Here&#8217;s [the link](https://www.edx.org/course/linuxfoundationx/linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-introduction-1621#.U5KbdI_7sjg) to the courrse page on edx.
