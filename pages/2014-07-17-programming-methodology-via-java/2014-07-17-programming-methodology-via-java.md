I found [this](http://see.stanford.edu/see/lecturelist.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111) course from Stanford to be very useful for learning programming basics and a bit more.

It was mentioned on [this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1s347g/how_i_learned_to_develop_android_apps_in_less/) on learning android developmet.

I was planning to go through the [CS50x course,](https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x/2014_T1/info) but I rather try this one first.
