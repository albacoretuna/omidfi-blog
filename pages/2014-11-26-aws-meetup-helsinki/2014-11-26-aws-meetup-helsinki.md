Last night there was a meetup about Amazon Web Services in Helsinki. I took a few notes:

Opswork. Â <a class="urlextern" title="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/" href="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/" rel="nofollow">http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/</a>

Simian army, netflix

-Amazon Lambda, gonna kill ansible, chef

&#8211; RDS for Aura, mysql by Amazon

&#8211; automatic deployment of dockers. Amazon ec2 container service

The future: AWS lambda Lambda functions in nodejs. Write your code and do nothing.

Big data needs better databases, mysql not interesting anymore.

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully managed message queuing service.
