I told you before in this post about the media course that I took part in courseera.

Today I looked for live examples of the Processing language. I ended up in their <a href="https://www.processing.org/exhibition/" target="_blank">showcase </a>with lots of eye catching samples. Also [I told you before in this post about the media course that I took part in courseera.

From which I particularly got interested in the works of a digital artist called LIA. You can see her art works in <a href="http://www.liaworks.com/livevisuals/about-visuals/" target="_blank">here.</a> She has videos, installations and even mobile apps based on her generative art forms. The sculptures she had made by 3d printing are also amazing.

I got interested both in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art" target="_blank">generative arts</a> and 3d printing. I hope I can buy a 3d printer <a href="https://store.makibox.com/#/printers?type=1" target="_blank">like this</a> one day.
