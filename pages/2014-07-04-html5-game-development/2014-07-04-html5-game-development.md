Making games must be fun! Today I tried to find out a bit about HTML5 game development. Those are games written in HTML, CSS and javascript for browsers, and mobile phones. I found a game engine that looks good: [Quintus](http://html5quintus.com/). You can try playing its demo game in [here](http://html5quintus.com/quintus/examples/platformer_full/).

I like the idea of being able to make games easily. I think I&#8217;ll go for it after I learn some jQuery and the like.
