I know already some stuff about Android however there&#8217;s a long road ahead to feel at home with it. So here comes my plan:

  1. I read: Thinking in Java, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. Revision 4.0 to learn JAVA. (I might also take a look at [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrandonioProductions/videos?sort=dd&tag_id=UCRclYvtDY8M6gb2n8bcDlKA.3.java&shelf_id=2&view=46)).
  2. I read [The Busy Coder’s Guide to Android Development](https://wares.commonsware.com#bongizmo) by [Mark Murphy](http://commonsware.com/blog/)

I keep updating this post.
