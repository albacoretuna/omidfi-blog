I landed up on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a> accidentally. And I started their Javascript and then Jquery course for fun <img src="http://modestdeveloper.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Actually I was reading a blog post written against the oversimplification of programming by Codeacademy but I ended up liking their approach. I think it&#8217;s a good start for people who have no experience with coding.
