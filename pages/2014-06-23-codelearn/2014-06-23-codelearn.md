After trying out CodeAcademy, I got interested in the Do and Learn programming tutorials. It seemingly works better than Watch,Do,Learn tutorials.

So I looked for more of those courses and found <a href="http://www.codelearn.org/" target="_blank">Codelearn.</a> It currently has a Ruby On Rails course and an Android course. I&#8217;m giving their Android course a try.
