The JavaScript world change very quickly! The next wonderful MV* framework can arrive any minute. It&#8217;s not easy to stay current in this ecosystem. One of my favorite ways to deal with that problem is listening to podcasts. When it comes to JavaScript, my pick is JSJabber, I have listened to almost all of the 154 episodes, and in this post I&#8217;m listing my top 5.

#### #124  The Origin of JavaScript with Brendan Eich

In this episode Brenden Eich, the guy who made JavaScript was the guest, and it was amazing! Listening to this episode would be the easiest  way to get to know about the origin of the language. <a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich" target="_blank">Listen now. </a>

#### #54 JavaScript Parsing, ASTs, and Language Grammar w/ David Herman and Ariya Hidayat

David, from Mozilla Research and author of Effective JavaScript, andAriya who made Phantom, made this episode very informative. David shows easy ways to get into language design and compiler worlds.<a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/054-jsj-javascript-parsing-asts-and-language-grammar-w-david-herman-and-ariya-hidayat" target="_blank"> Listen now. </a>

#### #12 Design Patterns in Javascript with Addy Osmani

Addy talks about design patterns and app architecture. I like it when people talk about the whole picture, I mean instead of talking about a single framework, you can hear from app architecture as a whole.<a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/012-jsj-design-patterns-in-javascript-with-addy-osmani" target="_blank"> Listen now. </a>

#### #4 Backbone.js with Jeremy Ashkenas

I generally think backbone should be the starting point when it comes to learning JavaScript MV* libraries or frameworks. It feels like the C of JavaScript frameworks, in terms of magic that happens behind the scene. The discussion between Jeremy, backbone, andYehuda Katz, was interesting.<a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/004-jsj-backbone-js-with-jeremy-ashkenas" target="_blank"> Listen now. </a>

#### #132 MV Frameworks with Craig McKeachie

To me the best thing about JSJabber is finding insight into what is getting built-in JavaScript land, and why people are doing so.When framework and language authors talk about their backgrounds and intentions when they were working on those projects makes it easier to recognize when and why each of those tools should be used in my own projects. Craig has written a book that compares three MV frameworks, in this talk you can hear a gist of the ideas in that book.<a href="http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/132-jsj-mv-frameworks-with-craig-mckeachie" target="_blank">  Listen now. </a>
