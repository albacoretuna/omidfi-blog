I&#8217;ve used skype heavily, since many years ago. And because I teach via skype, I use it&#8217;s chat messaging all the time.

Whenever I made a typo, I just typed the whole thing again. But recently an student from France, told me that I can simply right click on my written skype messages and edit them by choosing &#8220;Edit message&#8221;. I was happy and embarresd at the same time!

To get it even easier, you can just push the _up arrow key_ on your keyboard to edit your last message on skype! Have fun with it.
