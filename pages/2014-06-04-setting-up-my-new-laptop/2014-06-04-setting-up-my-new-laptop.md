So I bought a used Thinkpad T410 for 220 euros, so that I can work on Android more easily. My Eeepc was lagging too much, specially when i wanted to launch Android emulators.  I write about the process in here, so that I know what to do next time.

So far I&#8217;ve installed Ubuntu 14.04 on the laptop and I&#8217;m going to install Eclipse, and its companion plugins for android development. I also like to have Android Studio on this.

I start by downloading Android ADT bundle and Android Studio. Running any of those, resulted in a Java not found error. So I headed to download Java JDK and JRE.

I downloaded <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html" name="JDK7">Java SE 7u60</a>.  And installed it by following the installation on ubuntu section of [this website](http://javaandme.com/).

After installing JDK, I went to the ADT bundle folder and ran Eclipse. It launched and everything was working fine.
