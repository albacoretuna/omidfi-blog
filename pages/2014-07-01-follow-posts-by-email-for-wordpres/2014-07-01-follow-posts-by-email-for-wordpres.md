I needed a way to send email notifications about new posts on my selfhosted wordpress blog: www.zangefarsi.com. It turned out the feature will be available only after instaling a wordpress plugin called Jetpack.

I installed the plugin and it opened so many other features for my wordpress website. Recommended!
