Really, chances are that you don&#8217;t know JS. So, why not start reading the book series by that same title today?

> m sure you noticed, but &#8220;JS&#8221; in the book series title is not an abbreviation for words used to curse about JavaScript, though cursing at the language&#8217;s quirks is something we can probably all identify with

The series cover many JavaScript concepts from _this_ and _closures_, to _promises_ and further_._ In my humble opinion it&#8217;s definitely a must read for anyone interested in JavaScript.

The online version is freely available on [Github](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20&%20closures/README.md#you-dont-know-js-scope--closures), the paperbacks can be ordered as well.
