Tonight I went to a node.js meetup. It was held at sc5.io.

I listened to a couple of talks. First one by the CTO of Espootel, was about how recording the times of egg layings by his hens, involved him with Node.RED. A gui based on node, to control dataflow. With that you can read sensors and send them over different networks, by clicking.

Next one was about Stroid. An app development tool based on node made by appgyver.They were happy with node.
