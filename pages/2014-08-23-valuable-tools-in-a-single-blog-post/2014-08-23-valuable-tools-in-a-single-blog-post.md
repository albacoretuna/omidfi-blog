I found this page today, it includes lots of good stuff for teaching online.

<a href="http://www.connectwithlanguages.com/teaching-world-languages-through-technology.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to take a look.

My favorite ones were:

Storybird

Google Builder

Timeline JS

And I haven&#8217;t checked all of them yet.
