Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages by Bruce A. Tate is a book that aims to teach you, or at least show you some Ruby, Erlang, Prolog, Scala, Clojure, Haskell and Io in seven weeks.

Today I started reading the book, and so far I like it. I&#8217;m familiar with JavaScript, Java, C, and some Ruby, but I spent most of my time with JavaScript, so this book might help me become a polyglot, or at least start moving toward that goal.
